We are thinking of using the above template as homepage of website.
As of members page,we are trying that image flipping thing(on flipping it l show all details).
For workshops,projects,competitions & SIG we are trying something like google image thing(whenever u will click a project pic,a div will pop up showing its details and providing links for registration)
For games,we are thinking of a slideshow of boxes(each box will be a game pic) which on click will open a div showing snapshots and link to the game.
